# G00385144MobileApp

This App was meant to be bigger than expected but it just kept crashing on me so left it as it is right now.

The app was meant to be like a history app where you click on the province or the world it will then send you to another page
where you can then click on each county of the province you chose. Once you have clicked on a county it would have brought you to a new page giving you like a history lesson
about that county along with where this county is located on the map. But, everytime I went to create the app for each county and world country the app crashed and was confused
why it wasn't working and I spent so long trying to fix it I ended up giving up on it that's why the app isn't finished.

But yeah, that was my plan on the app. Struggled quite alot on this and panicked near the end but yeah.

Thanks, Glen
